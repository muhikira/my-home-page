                <p>This morning in  Dr Hagelin’s lecture, he spoken about different ideals purely scientific and philosophical
                    some of them fits in my ideas and personal experience, from what I learned when I was in my high school
                    and undergraduate, only guys who were strong in science like mathematics and physics were considered as
                    the best students, received the best favors from the smain-areachool, best scholarship were given to them,
                    and they were more confident and arrogant as Dr Hagelin said this morning when he was taking about the
                     guy who though that he knew everything and when one person asked him if he can ask him a question the
                     scientist in physics arrogantly  with much confident he replied that he can be asked anything,
                     then when he was asked about consciousness he got shocked and responded that he didn’t  know anything about it,
                      while the unified field of transcendental consciousness is the fundamental source of a human being,
                      before you learn physics you should learn yourself as a human as a person according to Dr Hagelin.</p>

                      <div class="info-box hide-small" class ="simple" class ="fancy">
                        <p> Back to my personal experience, all my scientists friends got the best scholarships in the highest schools
                            and universities and they still working in academics or in the big laboratories, and others who did human sciences,
                             and social sciences are the one who helped and still helping them to live with others, how to lead society live life
                              out of laboratories, most of people who weren’t ‘good’ in class they were good in sports, they were good athletes,
                              very good musicians, others went in business and became successful in their career while other succeed in their research
                              most of the are working in the big companies, big laboratories,... this confirm that there should not be any conflict at all,
                              because in life everyone needs someone to make the complementarity.
                           </p>
                      </div>


                      <p class="high"> I do agree with this logic that the unified field in quantum physics and unified field of transcendental consciousness
                   are likely the same and it’s open up new possibilities for human beings, according to Ms Rashmi Aiyappa: “the experience
                   of space is not possible without the arrow of time. This in fact agrees with some of the basic principles
                   adduced by Quantum physics and general theory of relativity. Space continues to expand even today. About 15 billion years ago
                   before Big Bang (if we can say so), there was no space. As time progressed space was created .
                   I do believe that this a open up new possibilities for human beings to think about what surrounding him/her,
                   think big, think about what the human being can to make this planet a better place to live more than it was before,
                    this will be an opportunity to think about climate change and its consequences to the future of this planets and
                    all the what was offered by the nature.
