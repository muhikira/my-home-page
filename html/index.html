            <p>This morning in  Dr Hagelin’s lecture, he spoken about different ideals purely scientific and philosophical
                 some of them fits in my ideas and personal experience, from what I learned when I was in my high school 
                 and undergraduate, only guys who were strong in science like mathematics and physics were considered as 
                 the best students, received the best favors from the school, best scholarship were given to them, 
                 and they were more confident and arrogant as Dr Hagelin said this morning when he was taking about the
                  guy who though that he knew everything and when one person asked him if he can ask him a question the 
                  scientist in physics arrogantly  with much confident he replied that he can be asked anything, 
                  then when he was asked about consciousness he got shocked and responded that he didn’t  know anything about it,
                   while the unified field of transcendental consciousness is the fundamental source of a human being, 
                   before you learn physics you should learn yourself as a human as a person according to Dr Hagelin.</p>

                <p> Back to my personal experience, all my scientists friends got the best scholarships in the highest schools 
                    and universities and they still working in academics or in the big laboratories, and others who did human sciences,
                     and social sciences are the one who helped and still helping them to live with others, how to lead society live life
                      out of laboratories, most of people who weren’t ‘good’ in class they were good in sports, they were good athletes, 
                      very good musicians, others went in business and became successful in their career while other succeed in their research 
                      most of the are working in the big companies, big laboratories,... this confirm that there should not be any conflict at all, 
                      because in life everyone needs someone to make the complementarity.
